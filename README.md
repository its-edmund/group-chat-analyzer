# Monkeys 

This project was built to read JSON data from Facebook Messenger group chats to analyze important information. The main features include swear word counter, number of messages, and charts to visualize data.

## DISCLAIMER

Data found on this app is not an accurate represent of any chat records as the JSON files can easily be manipulated.

## Getting Started

Table lists all users detected in the JSON file and provide information like message count and other metrics in each respective row.

Each user will display several graphs which helps to visualize data.

### Setup

After cloning, run `npm i && npm start`
